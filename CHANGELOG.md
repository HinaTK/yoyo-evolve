# Changelog

All notable changes to **yoyo-agent** (`cargo install yoyo-agent`) are documented here.

This project is a self-evolving coding agent — every change was planned, implemented, and tested by yoyo itself during automated evolution sessions. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.9] — 2026-04-21

12 commits spanning Days 50–52. Session profiling, fuzzy command suggestions, smarter output compression, poison-proof locks, and continued shell subcommand wiring — plus a sweep of test reliability fixes.

### Added

- **`/profile` command** — unified session summary in a bordered box showing model, provider, duration, turns, tokens, estimated cost, and color-coded context usage (Day 51)
- **"Did you mean?" fuzzy suggestions** — mistyped slash commands now suggest the closest match using Levenshtein distance with length-adaptive thresholds and unique prefix matching (Day 50)
- **5 more shell subcommands** — `changelog`, `config`, `permissions`, `todo`, and `memories` wired for direct CLI invocation without starting a session (Day 50)
- **`/config edit` subcommand** — opens `.yoyo.toml` or `~/.config/yoyo/config.toml` in `$EDITOR` (Day 50)
- **Proactive context budget warnings** — automatic warnings after each agent turn when context window usage is high (Day 50)

### Improved

- **Tool output compression** — command-aware filtering collapses `Compiling`/`Downloading` sequences, npm/pip install noise, and consecutive blank lines into compact summaries (Day 50)
- **Live bash output expanded** — increased visible partial output lines from 3 to 6 during command execution, with hidden line count header (Day 51)
- **Poison-proof mutex/rwlock handling** — all `.lock().unwrap()` calls in `commands_bg.rs` (13) and `commands_spawn.rs` (8) replaced with `lock_or_recover()` helper that recovers from poisoned mutexes instead of cascading panics (Day 52)

### Fixed

- **Integration tests burning 2.5 min per CI run** — two tests tried to connect to non-existent ollama, timing out with retries; switched to `--print-system-prompt` for instant exit (Day 51)
- **CWD race condition in test suite** — eliminated all `set_current_dir` calls from `commands_config.rs` and `commands_session.rs` tests by extracting `_in(root)` variants that take explicit paths (Day 51)
- **Flaky `build_repo_map_with_regex_backend` test** — fixed CWD race with explicit directory handling (Day 51)

## [0.1.8] — 2026-04-19

- **`/lint unsafe`** — scan for unsafe code usage (Day 46)
- **23 shell subcommands** — `help`, `version`, `setup`, `init`, `diff`, `commit`, `review`, `blame`, `grep`, `find`, `index`, `lint`, `test`, `doctor`, `map`, `tree`, `run`, `watch`, `status`, `undo`, `docs`, `update`, `pr` — all invocable directly from the shell without entering the REPL (Days 48–49)
- **Per-command bash timeout parameter** — `"timeout": N` (1–600 seconds) for individual bash tool calls (Day 44)
- **Co-authored-by trailer on `/commit`** — automatically credits the AI in git commit metadata (Day 43)

### Improved

- **Proper unified diffs (LCS-based)** — `edit_file` operations now show real unified diffs with context lines instead of walls of red/green (Day 48)
- **Comprehensive categorized help** — all 68+ REPL commands listed with descriptions, organized by category (Day 49)
- **Piped mode gracefully handles slash-command input** — no longer sends `/help` etc. to the model as a real prompt (Day 47)
- **Streaming output for `/run` and `/watch`** — live output rendering instead of buffered display (Day 45)
- **`/status` shows session elapsed time and turn count** — richer session awareness (Day 43)

### Fixed

- **Dead code and unused annotation cleanup** — removed stale `#[allow(dead_code)]` markers and unused code paths (Day 48)
- **Destructive-git-command guard in `run_git()`** — `#[cfg(test)]` guard prevents tests from accidentally committing/reverting in the real repo (Day 45)

## [0.1.7] — 2026-04-05

Patch release with critical bug fixes — UTF-8 crash prevention, Windows build support, and sub-agent security hardening.

- **Missing transition separator** — added separator between thinking output and text response sections (Day 22)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-20

Bug fix release addressing two community-reported issues.

### Fixed

- **Image support broken via `/add`** — images added with `/add photo.png` were base64-encoded but injected as plain text content blocks instead of proper image content blocks, so the model couldn't actually see them. Now `/add` detects image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and sends them as real image blocks the model can interpret. Closes [#138](https://github.com/yologdev/yoyo-evolve/issues/138).
- **Streaming output appeared all at once** — three root causes fixed: (1) spinner stop had a race condition that could prevent the clear sequence from executing, now clears synchronously; (2) thinking tokens went to stdout causing interleaving with text, now routed to stderr; (3) no separator between thinking and text output, now inserts a newline on transition. Also reduced the line-start resolve threshold so common short first tokens flush immediately. Closes [#137](https://github.com/yologdev/yoyo-evolve/issues/137).
